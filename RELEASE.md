# 0.1.1

- Removed an old unrelated directory `other/`
- Added a new directory `fiddles/` and the route of the same name to put custom fiddles in a safe place

# 0.1.0

- First pre-release to include a microframework (Silex) and namespacing. Before that, phpfiddler was a QAD script that growed organically.
